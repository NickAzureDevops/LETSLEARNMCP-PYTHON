# Part 1: Prerequisites and Setup (Python)

## What You'll Need
Before diving into MCP development, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### 2.1 Project Setup

If you haven't already set up your python environment:

### 2.1.1. Visual Studio Code
- Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Essential for MCP development and integration

### 2.1.2. Python 3.12+
- Install Python 3.12 or later from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Verify installation: `python --version` or `python3 --version`
- Ensure pip is installed: `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`

### 2.1.3. Python Extension for VS Code
- Install the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) extension
- Provides comprehensive Python development support
- Includes IntelliSense, debugging, and virtual environment management

### 2.1.4. Install UV
To install UV, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install uv 
```

### 2.1.5. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Using venv (recommended)
python -m venv mcp-env

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source mcp-env/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
mcp-env\Scripts\activate
```

### 2.1.6. Install packages 

```bash
uv sync 
```

### 4. Understanding MCP

Next lets look at the following topics: 
- What is Model Context Protocol?
- How MCP Servers work with AI assistants
- The client-server architecture
- Use cases and benefits


## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely access and interact with external tools, data sources, and services. Think of it as a bridge that allows AI models like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or Claude to:

- **Access Real-time Data**: Connect to databases, APIs, and live data sources
- **Execute Actions**: Perform operations like creating files, sending emails, or managing systems
- **Extend Capabilities**: Add custom functionality specific to your needs
- **Maintain Security**: Control what the AI can and cannot access

### Key Benefits for Python Developers

1. **Familiar Ecosystem**: Use your existing Python skills and rich library ecosystem
2. **Rich Tooling**: Leverage VS Code and Python extension for development
3. **Rapid Prototyping**: Python's simplicity enables quick MCP server development
4. **Async Support**: Built-in async/await support for efficient I/O operations
5. **Strong Typing**: Optional type hints with mypy for better code quality
6. **JSON Native**: Excellent JSON support with built-in libraries

```

### Use Cases

- **Data Analysis**: Connect AI to your databases and analytics systems
- **Automation**: Let AI assistants manage your development workflows
- **Documentation**: Generate and update documentation from live code
- **Testing**: Create and run tests based on AI analysis
- **Deployment**: Automate deployment processes with AI guidance
- **Web Scraping**: Build intelligent data collection tools
- **API Integration**: Create bridges to external services
